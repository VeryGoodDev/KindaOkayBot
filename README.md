# KindaOkayBot

Various things related to my Twitch chat bot. I currently just run the bot locally any time I stream, so it isn't always available in my Twitch chat like most bots (although I may look into changing this at some point).

The website is mostly just for the commands list, but maybe there will be other things to go there as well at some point. It currently just lists all the commands + some info, but in the future I will add filtering and/or search functionality for narrowing down what's shown.
